swarmwise	swarmwise	the word Swarmwise, the book’s title, is hard to translate to most languages as it has two meanings: “being smart about a swarm” and “[working with] swarm methods”. You may have to choose one of these meanings, and the latter meaning is the primary one, that the book is about swarm work methods, and the preferred meaning for a translation if the pun ambiguity cannot be replicated. (The first use of the word swarmwise in the book, “…this was entirely due to working swarmwise…”, reveals this primary meaning.) https://falkvinge.net/books/swarmwise-translation-notes/
oldmedia	oldmedia	oldmedia is another neologism used in the book. This may be hard to translate – the purpose of the word is to paint oldmedia as slightly out-of-touch, slightly stale, compared to newmedia or social media. Look at what social media has been called and find a translation for oldmedia that conveys the sense of looking down slightly on it, without coming across as overtly arrogant or unfriendly. https://falkvinge.net/books/swarmwise-translation-notes/
